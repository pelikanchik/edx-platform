Contributions are very welcome. The easiest way is to fork the repo and then
make a pull request from your fork. Before your pull request is merged, it will
be reviewed by at least one person. There may be feedback so expect comments on
the pull request. Add yourself to the AUTHORS file in your first pull request.

Please review:

* [Javascript Guidelines](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Javascript-Guidelines)
* [Testing](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/docs/internal/testing.md)

Coding conventions should be followed and your commit should *increase* test
coverage, not decrease it. For more involved contributions, you may want to
discuss your intentions on the mailing list *before* you start coding.

Before your first pull request is merged, you'll need to sign the
[individual contributor agreement](http://code.edx.org/individual-contributor-agreement.pdf)
and send it in. This confirms you have the authority to contribute the code in
the pull request and ensures we can relicense it.

If you have any questions, please ask on the
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/edx-code).
