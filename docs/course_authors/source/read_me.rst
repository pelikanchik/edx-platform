The edX "Getting Started with Studio" help and PDF documentation is created
using Sphinx_ and LaTeX_. You, the user community, can help update and revise
this documentation project on GitHub::

  https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/tree/master/docs/course_authors/source

To suggest a revision, fork the project, make changes in your fork, and submit
a pull request back to the original project: this is known as the `GitHub Flow`_.
All pull requests will need approval from an engineering contact at edX. For
more information, contact edX at docs@edx.org.
