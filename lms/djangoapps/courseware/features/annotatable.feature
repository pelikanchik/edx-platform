Feature: LMS.Annotatable Component
  As a student, I want to view an Annotatable component in the LMS

  Scenario: An Annotatable component can be rendered in the LMS
    Given that a course has an annotatable component with 2 annotations
    When I view the annotatable component
    Then the annotatable component has rendered
    And the annotatable component has 2 highlighted passages

  Scenario: An Annotatable component links to annonation problems in the LMS
    Given that a course has an annotatable component with 2 annotations
    And the course has 2 annotatation problems
    When I view the annotatable component
    And I click "Reply to annotation" on passage <problem>
    Then I am scrolled to that annotation problem
    When I answer that annotation problem
    Then I recieve feedback on that annotation problem
    When I click "Return to annotation" on that problem
    Then I am scrolled to the annotatable component

    Examples:
    | problem |
    | 0       |
    | 1       |
